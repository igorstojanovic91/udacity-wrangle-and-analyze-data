    "### Visual assesment\n",
    "**Quality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some tweet_ids contain links instead of numbers\n",
    "- Some sources contain multiple links and are hardly readable\n",
    "- Some Text is missing\n",
    "- Retweeted columns seem to miss a lot of values\n",
    "- Some expanded URLs have multiple entries (the same link was repeated several times)\n",
    "- Some rating numerators and denominators are missing\n",
    "- Some names are missing\n",
    "- Little information about doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo is available\n",
    "- Missing information of twitter_id_enhanced is not part of the data set\n",
    "- There were no issues identifliied in the image data set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programmatic Asssesment \n",
    "**Quality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tweets_archive` show more rows than `tweets_data` (15 in total), which is the exact amount of exeptions\n",
    "- `Tweet_ip` has  significant lower amount of rows: 2075 in total\n",
    "- Ids in exeption not part of `tweets_data`\n",
    "- `tweets_data` id should be string and not an integer\n",
    "- `tweets_data` created_at should be pd.date_time format instead of string\n",
    "- `twitter_archive` tweet_id should be string and not an integer\n",
    "- Texts in both datasets `twitter_archive` and `tweets_data` are not in full length\n",
    "- There is a really high numerator and denumerator in `twitter_archive`\n",
    "- Exanded_urls in `twitter_archive` do not work\n",
    "- `twitter_archive` in_reply_to_status_id and in_reply_to_user_id contain only 78 non-null values\n",
    "- `twitter_archive` contain only 181 non-null values of retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id and retweeted_status_timestamp \n",

    "**tidiness**\n",
    "\n",
    "- One single column for\"stages od dog\" (doggo floofer pupper puppo) in `twitter_archive`\n",
    "- All files should be joined to one \"Master file\""
